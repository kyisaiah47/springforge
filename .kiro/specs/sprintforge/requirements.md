# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Orbit is an all-in-one developer productivity suite designed to streamline team workflows through automation and gamification. The platform consists of four integrated modules: AutoStand for automated standup generation, PR Radar for pull request management, Retro Arena for collaborative retrospectives, and Debug Arcade for coding challenges. Built as a Next.js web application with Supabase backend, Orbit integrates with GitHub and Slack to provide seamless developer experience automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Team Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub and manage my team settings, so that I can access Orbit features and configure team-specific integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create or update their profile with GitHub data
3. WHEN a user accesses team settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of Slack webhook URLs
4. WHEN a user configures GitHub repository access THEN the system SHALL validate and store repository permissions
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login for protected routes

### Requirement 2: AutoStand Module - Automated Daily Standups

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want automated daily standup summaries generated from GitHub activity and posted to Slack, so that my team stays informed without manual status updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily cron job runs at 9am ET THEN the system SHALL fetch GitHub activity for each team member from the last 24 hours
2. WHEN GitHub data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate summaries including commits, PRs opened/merged, and issues worked on
3. WHEN summaries are generated THEN the system SHALL format them as structured Slack messages
4. WHEN Slack messages are ready THEN the system SHALL post them to the configured team channel
5. IF GitHub API fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry up to 3 times
6. WHEN users view AutoStand dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent standup history and team activity

### Requirement 3: PR Radar Module - Pull Request Intelligence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated PR scoring and reviewer suggestions, so that I can efficiently manage code reviews and identify risky changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PR is opened or updated THEN the system SHALL calculate a risk score based on size, complexity, and file changes
2. WHEN PR risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate reviewers based on code ownership and expertise
3. WHEN a PR becomes stale (>48 hours without activity) THEN the system SHALL post alerts to Slack
4. WHEN users access PR Radar dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all team PRs with scores, status, and suggested actions
5. IF a PR has high risk score (>7/10) THEN the system SHALL require additional reviewers
6. WHEN PR status changes THEN the system SHALL update dashboard in real-time

### Requirement 4: Retro Arena Module - Collaborative Retrospectives

**User Story:** As a scrum master, I want a digital retrospective board with sticky notes and voting, so that my team can conduct effective sprint retrospectives remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new retro THEN the system SHALL generate a board with "What went well", "What could improve", and "Action items" columns
2. WHEN team members join a retro THEN the system SHALL allow real-time collaborative editing of sticky notes
3. WHEN sticky notes are created THEN the system SHALL support categorization, colors, and anonymous posting
4. WHEN voting phase begins THEN the system SHALL allow dot-voting on sticky notes with configurable vote limits
5. WHEN retro is completed THEN the system SHALL export results to Markdown and optionally sync to Notion
6. IF multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully with real-time updates

### Requirement 5: Debug Arcade Module - Coding Challenges

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to solve coding challenges with built-in tests and compete on leaderboards, so that I can improve my debugging skills in a gamified environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses Debug Arcade THEN the system SHALL display available challenges categorized by difficulty and language
2. WHEN a user selects a challenge THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor with pre-written buggy code and test cases
3. WHEN a user submits a solution THEN the system SHALL run automated tests and provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL award points based on time taken and attempts made
5. WHEN challenges are completed THEN the system SHALL update user rankings on the leaderboard
6. IF a user gets stuck THEN the system SHALL provide progressive hints without penalty after 10 minutes

### Requirement 6: System Architecture and Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a scalable web application with reliable integrations, so that Orbit can handle team workflows without downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use Supabase for authentication, data storage, and file management
3. WHEN external API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and rate limiting
4. WHEN cron jobs execute THEN the system SHALL use reliable scheduling with failure notifications
5. IF system load increases THEN the application SHALL scale horizontally on Vercel platform
6. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide consistent UI/UX across all modules with responsive design

### Requirement 7: Data Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want my team's data protected and properly managed, so that sensitive information remains secure while enabling productivity features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
2. WHEN GitHub tokens are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure token storage with automatic refresh
3. WHEN Slack webhooks are configured THEN the system SHALL validate URLs and test connectivity
4. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block suspicious activity
6. WHEN data is exported THEN the system SHALL respect user permissions and data privacy settings
