# SprintForge Product Overview

**Mission:** Deliver a compelling, judge-friendly demo showing how SprintForge streamlines developer workflows with automation and collaboration.

## Core Modules (Demo Path)

- **AutoStand** → Generate and preview daily standups from GitHub activity, with Slack message output.
- **PR Radar** → Analyze PRs, highlight risks, and suggest reviewers.
- **Retro** → Run a retrospective with collaborative sticky notes and voting (seeded demo data OK).
- **Arcade** → Run a single coding challenge to demonstrate skill development.

_(Note: demo flows should bias toward speed, clarity, and visible outputs, not completeness.)_

## Key Features (Prioritized for Demo)

1. 🔑 GitHub OAuth login with seeded demo org/team.
2. 🔑 Slack integration with formatted standup & PR alerts.
3. 🔑 Real-time retro board updates (basic voting is enough).
4. 🟡 Export retro results (Markdown).
5. 🟢 Arcade leaderboard (stretch).

## Target Users

- Engineering teams wanting **automation of routine tasks** (standups, stale PR checks).
- Managers wanting **insights into PR quality & team health**.
- Teams running **retrospectives and agile rituals**.
- Developers wanting **lightweight coding challenges** for practice.

## Product North Star

- **Automate repetitive ceremonies** → less meeting fatigue.
- **Surface PR quality signals** → better code review throughput.
- **Foster collaboration** → retros with real-time updates.
- **Keep it fun** → arcade challenges as team-building.

## Demo Strategy

- Emphasize **end-to-end flow**: log in → see standup → open risky PR → run a retro → finish with arcade.
- Show **empty states + “Seed Demo Data” button** to accelerate.
- Keep **outputs visual & judge-friendly**: Slack preview cards, PR risk score, retro notes moving in real time, arcade tests passing.
